# Aws::STS

This gem is a stub that attempts to warn you that you installed the wrong package. AWS's STS library is bundled with aws-sdk-iam, you'll likely want to install that instead.

Right now this just thows an error on Aws::STS::Client.new. When I get some time i'll look into if it's possible to throw an error during the install process instead.
